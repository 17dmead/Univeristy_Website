            <p>My name is Daniel Mead. I was born in Hong Kong and lived there for two years before moving to Auckland. I grew up in Auckland with my parents and two sisters. My family would come down to Queenstown for the winter term every year to ski before finally moving here when I was nine. I live in Arrowtown and go to Wakatipu High School. When I think of what makes me stand out above other applicants is my determination to succeed in my chosen career. I have achieved NCEA Level 1 with Merit and got an English Merit Endorsement in NCEA Level 2. I enjoy sports as itâ€™s a way for me to push myself to my limits and let off some steam. Team sports have taught me about respect, working with and motivating others and the importance of effective communication. Attributes that I think I have. I also volunteer in my spare time to help remove wilding pines that are damaging New Zealand native bush around Arrowtown. Volunteer work for me is incredibly rewarding and I enjoy giving back to the community I live in. I consider myself to be a very social person with a very lively personality. I believe I would be a great fit in a hall as I have a lot to offer especially in regards to supporting others. I enjoy working in groups and competing in competitions with others.
